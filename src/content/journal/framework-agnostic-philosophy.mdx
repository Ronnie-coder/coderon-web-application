### The Wrong Question

The first question a potential client often asks a development agency is, "What's your stack?" It's an understandable question, but it's the wrong one. It's like asking a master carpenter, "Do you only use hammers?"

The tool is meaningless without understanding the problem it's meant to solve. At Coderon, we've built our reputation on a simple philosophy: we are problem-solvers first, and technologists second. This framework-agnostic approach is our single greatest asset.

### The Coderon Decision Matrix

Being framework agnostic doesn't mean we choose a technology at random. It means we run every project through a rigorous decision-making process, focusing on four key areas:

1.  **The Problem Domain:** What is the core business logic? An e-commerce site with a need for rapid UI updates might be perfect for React. A complex enterprise dashboard requiring rock-solid structure, like our Palmsure project, points towards Angular. A content-heavy site that needs speed and SEO might lead us to a static-site generator like Astro or Eleventy.

2.  **Scalability & Performance:** Where will this application be in five years? We analyze the long-term vision. Will it need to serve millions of users? Does it require real-time data streaming? The answers determine whether we use a monolithic framework or a micro-frontend architecture.

3.  **The Client's Ecosystem:** We don't build in a vacuum. If a client has an existing team of C# developers, building their new front-end in Blazor or a .NET-friendly framework makes long-term maintenance easier for them. The goal is to empower our clients, not lock them into a stack they can't support.

4.  **The Talent Pool & Future Proofing:** We choose battle-tested technologies with strong community support. This ensures that the project won't be stranded on a technological island a few years from now.

### Your Partner, Not Just Your Vendor

A vendor sells you a tool. A partner helps you achieve a goal. By remaining agnostic, we promise our clients one thing: you will always get the best possible solution for your specific problem, free from the bias of our own preferences. We put your mission first. That's the Coderon way.
