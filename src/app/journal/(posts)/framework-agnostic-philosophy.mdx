### The Wrong Question

The first question a potential client often asks a development agency is, "What's your stack?" It's an understandable question, but it's the wrong one. It's like asking a master carpenter, "Do you only use hammers?"

The tool is meaningless without understanding the problem it's meant to solve. At Coderon, we've built our reputation on a simple philosophy: we are problem-solvers first, and technologists second. This framework-agnostic approach is our single greatest asset.
